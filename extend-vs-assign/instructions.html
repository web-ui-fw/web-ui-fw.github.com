<p>To collect performance results:
	<ol>
		<li>Open <a href="extend-vs-assign.html">the page</a> in a browser</li>
		<li>Open the js console and clear it</li>
		<li>Hard-refresh the page many times (Ctrl+Shift+R). This assumes the js
		console is not cleared between refreshes. If it is cleared, record the line
		printed before doing the next refresh.</li>
		<li>Run the following command line in a terminal emulator. It will hang waiting
   for input.

<pre><code>cat - | awk -v 'old=0' -v 'oldcount=0' -v 'new=0' -v 'newcount=0' '
{
  if ($1 == "assign:") {
    new = new + $2; newcount++; 
  } else {
    old = old + $2; oldcount++;
  }
}
END {
  print( "assign: " ( new / newcount ) ", extend: " ( old / oldcount ) );
}'</code></pre></li>

		<li>Paste the output of the console into the terminal emulator. Make sure
		there is exactly one newline at the end.</li>
		<li>Press Ctrl+D (EOF)</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<p>At this point, you should see the average page load time in ms for the version
of the library that uses $.extend ("extend") as well as the one that uses
assignment ("assign").</p>
