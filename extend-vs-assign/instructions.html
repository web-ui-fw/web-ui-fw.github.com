<p>To collect performance results:
	<ol>
		<li>Open <a href="extend-vs-assign.html">the page</a> in a browser</li>
		<li>Open the js console and clear it</li>
		<li>Hard-refresh the page many times (Ctrl+Shift+R). This assumes the js
		console is not cleared between refreshes. If it is cleared, record the line
		printed before doing the next refresh.</li>
		<li>Run the following command line in a terminal emulator. It will hang waiting
   for input.

<pre><code>cat - | awk -v 'old=0' -v 'oldcount=0' -v 'new=0' -v 'newcount=0' '
{
  if ($1 == "assign:") {
    new = new + $2; newcount++; 
  } else {
    old = old + $2; oldcount++;
  }
}
END {
  print( "assign: " ( new / newcount ) "ms, extend: " ( old / oldcount ) "ms" );
}'</code></pre></li>

		<li>Paste the output of the console into the terminal emulator. The output
		is assumed to be such that the first column is the string "assign:" or
		"extend:" and the second column is the page load time in ms. Make sure the
		output conforms to that format. Make sure there is exactly one newline at
		the end of the output.</li>
		<li>Press Ctrl+D (EOF)</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<p>At this point, you should see the average page load time in ms for the version
of the library that uses $.extend ("extend") as well as the one that uses
assignment ("assign").</p>
